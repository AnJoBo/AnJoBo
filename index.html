    <section id="aboutMe" class="card">
        As someone who thrives for continuous growth, learning new technologies and implementing creative solutions further fuels my passion for Computer Software. Joining the IT community has greatly enriched my life, as it draws forth my strengths and challenges me to become the best developer that I can be.
        <br><br>
        My aim is to be part of a company that I can be proud of, offering my familiarity with Full-Stack development and military experience in team communication so that we can join the "front-lines" of what is shaping the world around us.

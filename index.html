                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>My journey in learning web development started when I was about thirteen years old. This is when I was first introduced to MySpace (social-networking also). Soon I became interested in customizing my own profile page and started scanning the web for page styles that I was liked. In time, I wasn't satisfyed with what was provided anymore and desired a little more control over how my page was displayed. Eventually I dared to tweek the codes that I found, did the "save, reload, observe the change" over and over until I had a basic understanding on how to manipulate it to do what I wanted. Back then I didn't see it as "web development", but instead a way to express myself on the web.<br><br>
                    From what I can gather (due to my lack of ever keeping records), I rebooted my interest in creating my own page years later and started doing some research in doing so. I came across many "free website" hosts that didn't require you to know any code to build your own page. At first I didn't mind having limited control and a URL that contained the hosts name within it, but soon wanted everything to be my own work - from scratch. Coming at the realization that getting my own URL would cost me money that I did not have, I turned to learning what was needed to make my own websites for free. I came across sites like <a href="http://www.codecademy.com" target="_blank">[Codecademy]</a>, <a href="http://www.khanacademy.org" target="_blank">[KhanAcademy]</a>, and many others that worked as an introduction or reference in writing your own HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more computer languages. I clocked in many hours at these sites though struggled getting past the "tutorial phase" to making my own content, so I strayed away for a while.<br><br>
                    Now I've come across a dream of being a creator of many things, most of which are digital or done digitally. I've expanded my interest from web development to application, game, and even hardware develpment. In recent years, I've done a lot of research and practiced a lot of skills and still feel very inadequate in the realm of programming. A good friend of mine introduced me to a path in which my core programming abilities could exponentially grow in the period of 3 months that will even land me a job as a developer or even a contractor. So for now, this is my main focus.</p>

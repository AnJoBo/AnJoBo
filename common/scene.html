        Ever since then, I've been fascinated with the possibilities that tech could do.<br><br>  
        My first exposure to any type of code was with the site MySpace, back when it was the social-media giant. Users started having custom pages and I wanted to find out how they did it, so I plugged away at the internet until I found out how to do this myself.<br><br> 
        Eventually, the idea that I could create my own games, mobile apps, and even AR/VR content become more and more attractive. So I decided that this was what I will 
        do for the rest of my life - <strong>software development</strong>.</div>

My interest in technology has been around since my earliest days. From the first time I played any game on a computer I thought to myself, "This is magic!" 
Ever since then, I've been fascinated with the possibilities that tech could do.

My first exposure to any type of code was with the site MySpace, back when it was the social-media giant. Users started having custom pages and I wanted to find out how they did it, so I plugged away at the internet until I found out how to do this myself.

Eventually, the idea that I could create my own games, mobile apps, and even AR/VR content become more and more attractive. So I decided that this was what I will 
do for the rest of my life - software development.
